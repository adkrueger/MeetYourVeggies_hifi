      <p>
        There are many different kinds of potatoes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Yukon Gold: A yellow potato that can be used in many recipes, such as
          in soups and mashed potatoes.
        </li>
        <li>
          Russet (or Idaho): Rough skinned and brown, this potato is great
          mashed, fried, or roasted.
        </li>
        <li>Fingerling: Smaller potatoes that are great roasted or boiled.</li>
        <li>
          Red: Red potatoes are known for their use in potato salad, but can be
          used in many applications other than this.
        </li>
        <li>And more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, sweet potatoes exist as well, but they provide a much
        different flavor and texture than their starchy, white counterparts. So
        in this tutorial we'll be focusing on non-sweet potatoes.
