              First, slice the veggies into burger-sized slices by cutting them
              into circular shapes. You'll also want to make sure the lettucs
              leaves are an appropriate size for the burger (if not, you can cut
              them as well).
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, take the Impossible Meat and form it into 4 (four) patties.
              Make a small dimple in the middle of each patty so that the
              burgers don't puff up too much while cooking.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, heat up a skillet to medium heat and add the oil.
            </li>
          </ol>

        <div class="steps">
          <ol>
            <li>
              Now, once the pan has heated up properly, add the patties onto it
              one at a time and with appropriate space between them. Add a pinch
              of salt to each burger for seasoning.
            </li>
            <li>
              Use a spatula to move each patty around so it doesn't get stuck
              and also uses the oil as necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check each burger occasionally by lifting it up to see if the
              underside looks cooked. Look at the picture on this step for a
              good gauge of the burgers being cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once one side has finished cooking, flip the patty onto the other
              side. This will allow both sides to cook evenly.
            </li>

            While you can read the nutrition facts on the back of the Impossible
            Meat container to learn more about the Impossible Meat. Despite the
            "meat" being plant-based, it isn't particularly healthy (being high
            in fat and cholesterol), so make sure it's not the only thing you're
            eating. However, the Impossible Meat is high in protein and
            calories, making it a filling meal.
          </p>
          <p>
            Feel free to serve things on the side of the burger, like fries
            other tasty veggies.
