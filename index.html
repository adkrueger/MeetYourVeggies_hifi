        >Meet Your Veggies is a website that aims to help users learn how to
        transition to a plant-based diet while avoiding many of the issues that
        others have experienced with such a change.</span

      <span
        >The website came about through the realization that there is tons of
        information on <i>why</i> someone should pursue a vegan diet, without
        actually explaining <i>how</i> to do so.</span
      >
      <br />
      <span
        >So, make yourself at home and learn all that you can about how to live
