              Prepare the oven by preheating it to 425F. This is usually done
              with the "Bake" setting.
            </li>
            <li>
              Chop the cauliflower into florets of the size seen in the picture.
              It's ok if some are smaller than others. The best way to do this
              is by cutting off the large, leafy stem and then cutting up into
              the head of the cauliflower to remove most of the stalks.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you have your florets, place them in a medium-sized mixing
              bowl. Drizzle the olive oil over the top, and then use your hands
              to mix the florets around so they all get covered in olive oil.
              This should leave the florets with a light sheen of olive oil.
            </li>
            <li>
              Now, spray a baking sheet lined with tin-foil with cooking spray
              (like PAM), and dump the bowl of florets onto the pan. Then, salt
              and pepper the florets as you see fit and place them in the oven
              for about 25 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
              Check the florets about 5 minutes before they should be done to
              make sure they aren't burnt. After the time is up, take the
              florets out and try one (after it cools down a bit) to see if they
              are cooked through. They should be somewhat firm but not mushy.
