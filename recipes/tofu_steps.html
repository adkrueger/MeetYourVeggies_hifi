            <li>
              Start by chopping all vegetables. Bok choy can be cut by removing
              the bottom-most part of the plant (the hard root part). Broccoli
              can be cut into small florets. Onions are diced. Snap peas are
              prepared by removing the string from the "front" of the pod by
              pulling the tip down along it.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, press the water out of the tofu by pressing it under
              something heavy, like a cast iron pan with cans on top, for about
              20 minutes. Cut the tofu into cubes when done, then place the
              cubes in a bowl and cover with marinade ingredients: soy sauce,
              rice wine vinegar, mirin, water, hoisin, and toasted sesame oil;
              feel free to add more or fewer of these as desired.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare noodles by boiling water as determined by ramen
              instructions and then placing the noodles in the water.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat toasted sesame oil in a large pan at medium-high heat, then
              remove the tofu from the marinade (setting the rest of the
              marinade aside). Place the tofu in the pan, and allow each side to
              cook until browned by flipping each cube occasionally with a
              spatula or tongs.
            </li>
            <li>
              Remove the tofu when done cooking, and place it aside for later
              use.
            </li>
          </ol>

              Now, in the same pan, heat more of the toasted sesame oil. Place
              chopped veggies in the pan, with broccoli, white parts of the bok
              choy, and onions going first. Add the snap peas and leafy parts of
              the bok choy after the other vegetables have softened.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the tofu marinade to the vegetables and allow it to reduce as
              the veggies cook in the above step. Taste vegetables occasionally
              and add soy sauce as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the tofu and noodles to the pan and mix, allowing each
              ingredient to get to know each other. After properly mixed, turn
              off the heat and serve.

            This dish has many different ingredients, and as such it is hard to
            get a good idea of its nutritional value. However, the tofu,
            noodles, and veggies provide a great source of fiber and protein, as
            well as several micronutrients.
