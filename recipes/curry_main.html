      <p>
        Curry comes in many varieties. Of course, many of these varieties can be
        different levels of spiciness, such as mild, hot, or
        burn-your-mouth-off. Many types exist as well:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Yellow/Green/Red Curry</li>
        <li>Panang</li>
        <li>Sour Curry</li>
        <li>Masaman Curry</li>
        <li>And many more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another appeal of curry is that you can include many different things in
        it, typically different kinds of vegetables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curry can also be cooked from scratch by gathering every spice that goes
        in it and combining them into a delicious dish. Or, you can simply buy a
        jar of pre-made curry sauce and cook each of the vegetables in it.
        Either way turns out great!
