              Start by chopping all vegetables. Peppers, onions, and tomatoes
              should all be diced. Sweet potatoes should be peeled and cubed.
              Avocado should be sliced after removing skin.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 425F, then toss sweet potatoes in oil and place
              them on a baking sheet with salt and pepper. Then, place the
              baking sheet in the oven for about 30 minutes or until sweet
              potatoes are done.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare rice by boiling 2 cups of water for every cup of rice
              used. Add salt and oil to water, and then add rice once it begins
              to boil. Cover with a lid and cook until water has cooked off,
              then remove rice and allow to cool for a few minutes then fluff it
              with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare tofu by crumbling the extra firm tofu onto a plate with
              your hands, and then adding the silken tofu and crumbling that
              into the firm tofu crumble.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add
              crumbled tofu. Tofu should be cooked to the point of being
              slightly tan, but make sure not to overcook it (to the point it is
              tan/brown).

            <li>
              Add taco seasoning packet to tofu, as well as about 1/2 cup of
              water (this may need to be increased, depending on the size of
              your pan and if the seasoning can coat the tofu) and stir to coat.
            </li>
            <li>
              In a separate pan, heat oil over medium high heat and add peppers
              and onions, as well as salt and pepper. These should cook until
              the peppers are slightly blistered and the onions are translucent.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add the corn and black beans to the tofu skillet. If using canned,
              make sure to remove water from the can first.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once everything is done cooking, remove pans from heat and
              assemble burrito bowls by placing rice in the bottom and covering
              with toppings as you see fit.

            This dish has many different ingredients, and as such it is hard to
            get a good idea of its nutritional value. However, the tofu, rice,
            and veggies add up to plenty of fiber, protein, and vitamins.
