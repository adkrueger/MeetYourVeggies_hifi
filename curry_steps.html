            <li>
              Start by chopping all vegetables. Peppers, onions, and carrots
              should all be diced. Potatoes should be peeled and cubed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Preheat oven to 425F, then toss potatoes in oil and place them on
              a baking sheet with salt and pepper. Then, place the baking sheet
              in the oven for about 30 minutes or until potatoes are done (they
              should be soft and browned/blistered).
            </li>
            <li>
              Prepare rice by boiling 2 cups of water for every cup of rice
              used. Add salt and oil to water, and then add rice once it begins
              to boil. Cover with a lid and cook until water has cooked off,
              then remove rice and allow to cool for a few minutes then fluff it
              with a fork.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, press the water out of the tofu by pressing it under
              something heavy, like a cast iron pan with cans on top, for about
              20 minutes. Cut the tofu into cubes when done.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, heat oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add tofu.
              Tofu should be cooked to the point of being slightly browned on
              each side. Set tofu aside when done cooking.
            </li>

              Add more oil to the same pan, then add chopped vegetables to the
              pan and cook until softened (try tasting them for texture if you
              aren't sure when "cooked" is).
            </li>
            <li>
              Add tofu, potatoes, and chickpeas (without water from can), then
              add the curry sauce and tomato puree.
            </li>
            <li>
              Mix the contents of the pan until everything is well coated and
              cooked.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once everything is homogenous, add rice to a plate, covering half
              of it. Then add curry to cover the other half, and enjoy!
