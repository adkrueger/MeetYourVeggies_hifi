      <h4 class="header">What kind of tofu should I get?</h4>
      <span>It depends! There's a few different kinds of tofu:</span>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Extra firm: A firm tofu that is generally used in things like stir
          fries or curries.
        </li>
        <li>
          Silken tofu: An almost gelatinous tofu that is used in various
          recipes, from desserts to sauces.
        </li>
        <li>
          Sprouted tofu: Similar to firm tofu, but has slightly better
          nutritional value and higher calorie count
        </li>
      </ul>
      <span
        >Keep in mind that when preparing tofu, you'll have to press out some
        water to get the texture that you want. Another piece of advice,
        especially for firm tofu, is that you should freeze it for a couple of
        days and thaw before using. This gives the tofu a much firmer
        texture.</span
