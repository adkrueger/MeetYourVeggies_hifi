Project: Meet Your Veggies
Author: Aaron Krueger

Meet Your Veggies aims to provide an interface for users of any age group transitioning to a 
plant-based diet to learn how to achieve said transition.
Many current applications provide an interface on reasons why one should go vegan, but not how, 
which Meet Your Veggies plans to address. Meet Your Veggies provides tutorials for recipes, a tool to alter a grocery list containing 
animal products, and a search tool that allows users to learn about alternatives directly.



This project consists of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. You shouldn't 
have to download anything to run the program, assuming you can access
the github pages page for this project. All CSS and JS is linked within
the project and require no downloads. If you are unable to access the 
github pages page for this project, check the instructions below.

The easiest way to access the prototype is by opening a browser
and navigating to:
https://adkrueger.github.io/MeetYourVeggies_hifi/

The prototype can also be ran by opening a server locally and 
then opening the project.

This can be done a couple of ways:
 -  Use Python to open the project. Download the project file and navigate to the 
    directory it is in using command prompt (Windows) or terminal (OSX, Linux).
     - If you have Python 3, type “py –m http.server” and then use a web browser to go to localhost:8000
     - If you have Python 2, type “python –m SimpleHTTPServer” and use a web browser to navigate to localhost:8000

If neither of the above work, use Visual Studio Code and download the Live Server Plugin. Then, right click 
the index.html file and select the “Open with Live Server” option.

The project can also be ran by opening the project directly from the directory is in on your computer, where 
you can right-click index.html and click "Open with" and then select your web browser of choice.
