            <li>
              First, peel potatoes with a knife or a peeler. Make sure to wash
              each potato afterwards so that there's no dirt left over from the
              knife.
            </li>
            <li>
              Next, use a knife to cut the potatoes into long slices or wedges,
              like seen in the picture. Make sure they're approximately uniform
              in size - otherwise, they might not cook evenly.
            </li>
            <li>
              Heat oil in a skillet on the stovetop at medium high. Once the oil
              and pan have warmed up, add the potatoes with salt and pepper to
              the pan.
            </li>
            <li>
              Allow potatoes to cook on each side. You'll know the potatoes are
              cooked when they gain a nice brown, crispy color. This should be
              replicated on all sides. You may want to use tongs to flip each
              wedge of potato as needed.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once each potato is cooked through, take one off and let it cool a
              bit, then taste it for texture. The potato should be relatively
              light and fluffy with no crunch if it is cooked through. If not
              cooked through, simply place the pan back on the stove until the
              potatoes are cooked.
            </li>
          </ol>

            Potatoes go great with many different recipes, such as burgers or
            other hearty dish. They also pair well with vegetables like peppers,
            tomatoes, asparagus, and more. If you want to try this recipe again
            sometime, try adding herbs like rosemary or thyme to get a different
            flavor profile.
          </p>

            Potatoes are high in carbs and calories, thanks to the amount of
            starch they contain. They also contain fiber, potassium, and
            vitamins like vitamin C and B6.
