      <p>
        There are many kinds of cauliflower, such as white, green, and even
        purple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cauliflower can have interesting shapes too, such as small peaks and
        even spirals along the top of the head. This doesn't change much about
        the flavor or texture of the veggie though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Make sure to choose cauliflower that has minimal miscoloration on the
        head.
